# Restaursnts

Restaursnts app to track the retsuarsnts you visited and to see where your friends recently went. Built with Ruby, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, etc. 

With *Restaursnts* you can create an account, create and edit new restaurants, track your restaurants and see restaursnts where your friends went.

Your restaursnts page is automatically sorted in descending date order, so your most recent places will always be at the top. 

## To run this app

Fork and clone this repo. 

`cd` into the project folder. 

Run `bundle install` then run `shotgun` and navigate to the appropriate local address. 

*This app is not currently deployed because I haven't dealt with setting up the database on an actual server.*
